          <h2>Removing XmlBeans...</h2>
<p class="meta">20 Apr 2008</p>

<p>Actually I like XmlBeans a lot. Define a XML-Schema (XSD) for your XML-File, throw XmlBeans at it and  let it generate some Java classes. Voila. XML-Binding. Validate against the XML-Schema, easily access your XML-File from within Java, etc... XML? Java? Done!</p>

<p>There's even a Maven Plugin for it, so one can generate the classes on the fly within your build process. Great Stuff!</p>

<p>So why would some half insane person want to removed it?</p>

<p>Well, one drawback is the size of the lib. Because XmlBeans is your Swiss army knife of XML-Java-Binding it is rather large being around 2,6 MB in size. Altough this is not that bad in DSL-century you can still notice it when running a Java Applet or Java Webstart.</p>

<p>Another and somewhat profoundly drawback is, that in a Java Webstart it seems to parse Xml-Files very very slow. I'm not sure what exactly causes this slowdown but from what I grasp this might be a classLoader issue or something. When run localy everything works fine but from within a Webstart Version it runs painfully slow. I've tried to pinpoint what causes these issues but had not much luck in doing so.</p>

<p>Now I've settled to get rid of XmlBeans and replace it with some simpler form of xml parsing. What I'm currently using is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.extreme.indiana.edu&#47;xgws&#47;xsoap&#47;xpp&#47;">XPP3<&#47;a>. Hopefully this will remove the issues. The lib is very small (25 KB) and very fast. The only drawback so far is that I lose the Schema-Validation. I'll keep the XML-Schema for development and documentation purposes but the actual Loader inside Nifty won't check against the Schema anymore. Which is a bit sad but something I can't do anything about at this very moment.</p>
